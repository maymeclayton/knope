                For years, Leslie Knope has served the city of Pawnee,
                Indiana as Deputy Director of the Parks Department. She, her husband, Ben,
                and their triplets moved to Lexington 3 years ago. She enjoys work, waffles,
                and talking on the phone approximately 8 times a day with her best friend, Ann.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since moving to the great city of Lexington she has felt compelled to serve.
                She truly believes that government is by the people for the people. Her
                experience with the Parks Department in Pawnee and eagerness to serve
                make her the best candidate for the position of Constable.

              Her experience in the Pawnee Parks Department brought her in close contact
              with how overreach can negatively impact a community. Neighboring town Eagleton
              consistently tried to influence the goings on of Pawnee and Knope was able to
              minimize the impact. Knope will ensure that surrounding counties will stay out of
              of Fayette County's way.</p>

              for the common folk. Knope promises to clean up the parks in Lexington and
              give them back to the fine citizens of Lexington.
